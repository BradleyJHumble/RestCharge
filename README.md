# RestCharge
Rest API for billing and invoicing. 

In server folder it contains an rest api that uses https requests to charge customers

In test-client folder it will contain an simple web application demostrating the calling.


The reason for this build is to have an easy template for external payments. If you have customers on your website, mobile application and or software you can utilize an external payment system instead of having to internally set it up in each application as well as worrying about each maintenance...

This respository is still being worked on.
